Kent Dodds egghead course

in section two he shows a class refactoring to use hooks

first off, he has put proptypes and defaultprops in as a static on the class

when switching to function component, he sets propTypes on the Query function as Query.propTypes

he adds the default props as a function parameter default value

class Query extends Component {
	static propTypes = {...}
	static defaultProps = {...}

APPARENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPORT REACT ANYMORE, YOU CAN JUST IMPORT {COMPONENT}

useReducer => he is using dispatch, but calling it setState - he makes dispatch act like a setState function 
this is simple - he just merges in the data that he passes into setState into a new state obj by using the spread operator
